üì¶ Operational Logistics & Supply Chain Performance DashboardProject Goal: To transform raw transactional data into a four-page strategic Power BI dashboard focused on cost reduction, velocity management, and supplier quality assessment, aligning with core business metrics.Analyst: Stephen Chinenye Anyalewechi | [Your LinkedIn Profile URL] | [Your Power BI Service Share Link (if published)]üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Project FilesReport File: SUPPLY CHAIN POWER BI DASHBOARD.pbixSource Data: supply_chain_data_cleaned.csvTools: Power BI Desktop (Power Query M, DAX), Data Visualization.üßπ Key Data Modeling & DAX Measures (Analyst Skills)The foundation of this dashboard relies on creating meaningful, consolidated metrics:Metric TypeExample DAX Formula / Query StepPurposeCost EfficiencyAvg Cost per Product = DIVIDE(SUM([Shipping costs]), SUM([Number of products sold]))Benchmarks transportation expense directly to unit volume, allowing for effective carrier comparison.Velocity MetricAvg Lead Time Days = AVERAGE([Lead time])Establishes the core measure of operational speed for the Executive Summary.Performance ValueTotal Revenue from Slow Shipments = CALCULATE(SUM([Revenue generated]), [Lead time category] = "Slow")Quantifies the financial value tied up in underperforming logistics streams.Data TransformationCreation of a Lead time category column in Power QuerySegments continuous numerical data into actionable buckets (Fast, Medium, Slow) for visualization filtering.üöÄ Key Insights & Dashboard StructureThe 4-page structure guides users from high-level financial impact to granular operational details:1. Executive Summary & Performance Overview (The "What")Focus: High-level financials and identifying immediate bottlenecks.Core Visual: Volume vs. Speed Scatter Chart. This plots Total Products Sold (Volume) against Average Lead Time (Speed) to instantly highlight High-Volume/Slow-Fulfillment products (the "Bottlenecks") that require urgent operational intervention.KPIs: Total Revenue, Total Profit, and Total Units Sold.2. Logistics & Velocity Deep Dive (The "How Fast")Focus: Identifying the most and least efficient components of the shipping process.Key Scorecards:Carrier Efficiency: Compares Avg Shipping costs against Avg Lead time to negotiate optimal contracts.Transportation Mode Analysis: Breakdown of costs and speed by Road, Rail, and Air.3. Inventory and Production Insights (The "How Prepared")Focus: Managing quality risk and stock health.Key Visuals: Supplier Defect Rate Scorecard (ranked by Avg Defect rates) to manage procurement risk, and analysis of manufacturing lead times against production volumes.üåê View and InteractDownload: Clone this repository to get the PBIX file.Open: The report is self-contained. Open the SUPPLY CHAIN POWER BI DASHBOARD.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.Explore: Navigate the four pages and interact with the slicers to see the analysis slice by different Routes and Product types.
